    <h2>Instructions: </h2>
    <ul>
        
        <li><b>Step 1: </b>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Whisk together flour, baking powder and salt; set aside. In separate bowl and using electric mixer, beat butter with sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one fully before adding the next one; beat in vanilla.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2: </b> With mixer on low speed, add flour mixture in 3 parts alternately with milk in 2 parts, starting and ending with flour mixture, and scraping bowl as needed between additions.</li>
        <li><b>Step 3: </b>Spoon or scoop batter into prepared muffin cups, about two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until tester comes out clean when inserted into centre of cupcakes. Let cool completely on rack.</li>
        <li><b>Step 4: </b>Beat butter until light and fluffy. With mixer on low speed, beat in icing sugar, cream, vanilla and salt until smooth, adding up to 2 tbsp (30 mL) more cream if needed. Increase speed to high; beat for 1 to 2 minutes or until frosting is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><b>Step 5: </b>Add frosting to piping bag fitted with round tip; pipe over cupcakes. Alternatively, spoon frosting into resealable bag and clip off one corner to pipe over cupcakes, or spoon onto cupcakes.</li>
